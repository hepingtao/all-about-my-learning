# Everything about Java

## Anonymous Classes

* An anonymous class is a local class without a name.
* An anonymous class is defined and instantiated in a single succinct expression using the `new` operator.
* While a local class definiton is a statement in a block of Java code, an anonymous class definiton is an expression, which means that it can be included as part of a larger expression, such as a method call.
* When a local class is used only once, consider using anonymous class syntax, which places the definiton and use of the class in exactly the same place.
